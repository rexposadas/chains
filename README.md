# chains
A blockchain written in Go

Inspired by this tutorial: https://jeiwan.net/posts/building-blockchain-in-go-part-1/


# Updates I made after the tutorial

1. Used swagger to generate models.


# 


# Building and running the app

`make run` builds the binary to /tmp/chains and runs it.

`make models` generate the models from `swagger.yaml`.
